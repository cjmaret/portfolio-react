## Project Description / Functionality: 

- This is my portfolio, built and designed by yours truly, and serves as an introduction of myself as a web developer, and a showcase for the projects I'm most proud of. The site is a single-page, using react-scroll to get a smooth scrolling feel.
- The profile was drawn by myself, as were all the icons.
- The project-list section is mapped over and populated with data from each of my projects.
- Finally, I bought and implemented a CNAME to have a custom domain while it's hosted on Github Pages

## Project Technologies/Techniques:
- React
